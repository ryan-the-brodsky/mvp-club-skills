## The Work Loop

These skills support the MVP Club Work Loop methodology:

**Articulate** → **Build** → **Prompt** → **Execute** → **Evaluate** → **Iterate**

AI proficiency isn't about learning tools—it's about learning to think and work differently.

## Philosophy

- **Practice over training** - Skills are learned through doing, not reading
- **Human + AI Teams** - You drive goals and judgment; AI accelerates execution
- **Confidence through competence** - Real capability comes from shipping real things
