# Evaluate My Build

A skill for systematic evaluation of what you've built against your original goals.

## Why This Exists

Evaluation is the most commonly skipped phase. We get excited about building, then move on to the next thing without reflecting on what worked.

## Usage

After building something, ask for evaluation:
- "Evaluate this"
- "Review my build"
- "How did I do?"
- "What's missing?"

Works best when you have a PRD or clear goals to compare against.

## Part of the Work Loop

This skill supports the **Evaluate** phase:
Articulate → Build → Prompt → Execute → **Evaluate** → Iterate

## Installation
