# PRD Generator

A skill for creating clear Product Requirements Documents before you start building.

## Why This Exists

Most vibe-coded projects fail not because of bad prompts, but because of unclear thinking. This skill enforces the "Articulate" phase of building.

## Usage

Just start describing what you want to build. The skill activates when it detects project planning intent.

Examples:
- "I want to build a habit tracker"
- "Help me plan out my app idea"
- "Let's create a PRD for my project"

## Part of the Work Loop

This skill supports the **Articulate** phase:
Articulate → Build → Prompt → Execute → Evaluate → Iterate

## Installation
