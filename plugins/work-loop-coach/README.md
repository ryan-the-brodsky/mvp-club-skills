# Work Loop Coach

A methodology skill that guides you through effective Human + AI collaboration.

## The Work Loop

**Articulate** → **Build** → **Prompt** → **Execute** → **Evaluate** → **Iterate**

This isn't a rigid process—it's a mental model for working effectively with AI. The coach helps you recognize where you are in the loop and what to do next.

## Usage

The skill activates automatically during building tasks. It provides gentle guidance without slowing you down.

## Philosophy

AI proficiency isn't about learning tools—it's about learning to think and work differently. This skill embeds that thinking into practice.
